Lets first understand the syntax of each JSON key and how you can use it.

"pattern" is the input which you want to tell to the Bot

"template" is used to make the Bot understand how the response should be built. 

"voice" should be used when you want Bot to speak what it suppose to say

"context" is to make Bot understand, the conversation is about which topic. For example please see the "Tell me a joke" example

"dependson" should be used when you want Bot to wait for some condition to fullfill. For example please see the coffee example
